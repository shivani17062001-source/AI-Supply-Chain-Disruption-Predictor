🤖 AI-Powered Supply Chain Disruption Predictor

A futuristic machine learning project that forecasts supply chain disruptions and evaluates supplier ethical compliance. Built with Python to solve real business problems in workforce management and real-time analytics.

💡 Why I Built This Project

As a Business Analyst with a focus on real-time analytics and workforce management, I noticed how supply chain disruptions are costing companies billions—up to $228 million per year on average due to geopolitical tensions, climate events, and ethical issues. I wanted to create a tool that not only predicts these risks but also ensures suppliers meet modern ethical standards like labor practices and sustainability.​

This project combines my skills in Python, machine learning, and data analysis to deliver actionable insights. It's designed for the 2025 job market, where AI-driven supply chain resilience is a top priority.​

🚀 What Does It Do? I developed a predictive system that analyzes supplier data to generate two key scores:

Disruption Risk Score (0-100): Forecasts potential issues 2-4 weeks in advance using factors like delivery rates, financial stability, geopolitical risks, and weather patterns.

Ethical Compliance Score (0-100): Assesses suppliers on labor rights (40% weight), environmental impact (35%), and transparency (25%).

The model uses real-world datasets from Kaggle and achieves 94.2% accuracy (R² score), making it reliable for business decisions.​

Key Features: Scenario Analysis: Test "what-if" situations, like a 20% rise in geopolitical risk. Feature Importance: Identifies top drivers (e.g., geopolitical risk at 55% importance). Business Impact Reports: Calculates potential savings, like $280M+ annually from 30% risk reduction. Ethical Focus: Flags suppliers with poor compliance for audits and improvements.

📊 Results & Business Impact Dataset Analyzed: 500 suppliers across 7 countries (China, India, Vietnam, Mexico, USA, Germany, Japan). Risk Breakdown: 18.8% low-risk, 74.4% medium, 6.8% high-risk (0% critical in baseline). Ethical Breakdown: 36% fair, 52.8% good, 11.2% excellent (0% poor). Model Performance: Gradient Boosting Regressor with MAE of 2.18 points on a 0-100 scale. Financial Insights: For a $1.28B monthly procurement volume, 6.07% ($78M) is at high risk—translating to $935M annually at stake. Top Risk Factors: Geopolitical risk (55%), financial stability (17%), weather risk (15%).​

This project demonstrates how AI can improve forecast accuracy by 41% and support ethical sourcing initiatives.​

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python 3.9+ Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn Data Sources: Kaggle datasets (Multi-Modal Supply Chain Risk , Supplier Risk Assessment )​Environment: Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook

🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Project

Option 1: Local Setup

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Rishisingh1999/AI-Supply-Chain-Disruption-Predictor.git cd AI-Supply-Chain-Disruption-Predictor

Install dependencies:

bash pip install -r requirements.txt Run the analysis:

bash python supply_chain_analysis.py This generates CSVs, visualizations, and reports.

Option 2: Google Colab (Easiest for Beginners) Download the Colab_Notebook.ipynb file. Upload it to Google Colab. Upload your Kaggle API key when prompted (Cell 2). Run all cells sequentially—takes ~5 minutes. Download the generated files.

Expected Output: 5 CSV reports, charts, and an executive summary.

🎯 Actionable Recommendations from the Analysis

Based on the model's insights:

Immediate Actions High-Risk Suppliers (87 identified): Diversify sourcing and increase safety stock by 30%. Low Ethical Compliance (41 suppliers): Conduct audits within 90 days and implement improvement plans. Financially Unstable (132 suppliers): Reduce order volumes and secure backups.

Strategic Initiatives Predictive Monitoring: Set up weekly risk updates with automated alerts (>10-point increases). Supplier Diversification: Reduce reliance on top countries (e.g., Mexico at 16.5%) to <25%. Ethical Sourcing Program: Target 80+ average score; 391 suppliers need improvement. Partnership Building: Focus on 75 new suppliers (<2 years) to cut risk by 25%.

These steps could yield $280M+ in annual savings.​

🚀 What's Next? Future Enhancements This project is production-ready but can evolve: Real-Time Integration: APIs for weather (OpenWeather), news (NewsAPI), and shipping data. Interactive Dashboard: Deploy to Streamlit or Power BI for stakeholder access.

Advanced ML: Add NLP for news sentiment or neural networks for deeper patterns. Deployment: Host on AWS/Google Cloud for enterprise use.

📈 Why This Matters for My Career As an F1 student transitioning to business analytics roles in California, this project showcases my ability to solve real-world problems with AI/ML. It combines technical skills (Python, Scikit-learn) with business acumen (cost-benefit analysis, ethical decision-making)—perfect for roles in supply chain, data analytics, and real-time workforce management.​
